Apple just dropped the shiny new M4 MacBook Air, but what accessories do you need to make the most out of it, here we take a dive into some of the best:

* Chargers
* Docks
* Keyboards
* Mice
* And more!

Let’s start with charging accessories. When you first get your MacBook you should be getting a power brick and a cable, I like to have the most powerful power brick I possible can, I think 70W or higher is good for any MacBook Pro user (like myself) that isn’t using 2 or more external displays. For the cable, just use the one in the box, or, if you have one of the MagSafe MacBooks, I would still get a high quality usb-c cable because (in my opinion) I just prefer USB-C connection. Also, I recommend getting a smart plug so you can remotely control the plug to get the most out of your MacBook’s battery.


Now, I have an M1 MacBook Pro (512GB 8GB RAM) and that means I don’t really get any ports, only two USB-C and a headphone jack, I would recommend getting a USB-C hub. They are very cheap and normally come with some USB-A, HDMI and an SD Card slot. I find the lack of the SD card slot really annoying as I need to transfer photos from my camera to my laptop and I have to get out the USB-C hub every time and it really just isn’t as easy as plugging it directly into the laptop like with the newer MacBook Pros. 

For a keyboard, the built in keyboard is actually really great, however, I have a very niche issue where, when I am typing with my laptop keyboard, the metal strap on my Apple Watch is scraping all over the palm rests, making a horrible scratching sound. Anyways, the built in keyboard is good but the lack of function row keys is quite annoying as I have the Touch Bar (I am considering a refurbished M2 MacBook Air 15 right now [in starlight of course!]) There are 4 keyboards that I personally recommend and they won’t break the bank but they aren’t exactly cheap. For those of you who like the Macbook’s keyboard, quite obviously, you should be getting the apple Magic Keyboard, I recommend Touch ID because it is really useful for logging in and even making transactions and verifying stuff, you can pick up a refurbished (small) magic keyboard without Touch ID for around £60 on amazon. If you like the MacBook keyboard you could also go for the Logitech MX Keys. This is a great alternative to Apple’s keyboard as it has a very similar design and typing experience for a cheaper price. Now, for those of you who like mechanical keyboards, we have, a really underrated personal favourite of mine, the KEMOVE DK61, this keyboard is available in an all white and it has a very comfortable typing experience, I myself don’t even really like mechanical keyboards due to the noise but this keyboard has to be one of the best I have ever tried and it matches the Apple aesthetic. Then, we have, the most expensive on the list, the Logitech MX Mechanical, and this keyboard is like heaven as it has low travel, it is mechanical and it also looks really good. I got to try one of these at a friend’s house once and sure, it may be around £150 but I think it is a worthwhile investment for anyone who uses their computer alot as you don’t want hand cramps from a low quality keyboard.


Phew, that was alot, now, for the mouse, hot take, the Magic Mouse is the best mouse for Mac. I use the one with the batteries but it is basically the same as the one with charging. I don’t really understand the charging ’issue’ because you are going to be charging it around 5 times a year at most so it really isn’t a problem, also, the ergonomics are really good in my opinion, I just feel like my hand is laying flat on the table and it feels really good, also, the gestures are awesome. Also, being made by Apple, the paring process is super simple and I don’t have any issues with this mouse, it isn’t even that expensive compared to other high end mouse. Next, we have the Logitech mx master 3s for Mac, this is a classic, I never liked it in my opinion but from the reviews and other people, they say that it is really good, the ergonomics were always just not really comfortable for me and I think maybe because that is I use the Magic Mouse all day. Also, the amount of buttons was kind of overstimulating for me if I am being honest, there are like, 7 buttons on that mouse compared to ONE on the Magic Mouse. Another great option that is BUILT IN to your MacBook is the trackpad, this is excellent as the gestures are good, it is large enough, built in and feels really premium.


For a cover I use HYZUO 13 Inch Laptop Sleeve Case with Stand from Amazon, it isn’t something special or flashy but it gets the job done, it protects my MacBook, comes with a tech bad and also acts as a stand. I use the brown colorway because I like that aesthetic personally, I just feel like you should get a laptop sleeve that fits your laptop snugly and is waterproof, other wise it is basically personal preference.
