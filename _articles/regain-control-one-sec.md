For this weeks App Tuesday we are going over one of my all time favorites: Onesec. This app is a screen time manager on steroids. What it essentially does is force you to do breathing exercises you want to open an app and just scroll. This can be really useful if you are spending all of your time scrolling. By the way, if you are interested in the wallpaper shown in the cover image, you can get it on my gumroad, https://badiestudios.gumroad.com

Now, let’s dive into why this app is great. 

This app is available on iPhone and Android but the iPhone app is much simpler and easier to use. It is very simple to setup and it is very straightforward. All you do is select your apps and you are basically done. 

Another feature that onesec features is the ability to add ’re-intervention’ which means that, after you have opened the app (and done your breathing exercise) you have to choose a time and then, after that time, you have to do that breathing exercise again.

Onesec also features a really cool dashboard that shows you the estimated amount of time it has saved you and the amount of times it has prevented you from accessing a certain app. I am quite proud of how my dashboard is looking so far:

Another thing that I find pretty cool is the browser extension. This is the same as the mobile app but it now also works on your browser so you will not be caught lacking.

This was quite a short one as the app is quite simple and doesn’t require that much to use and start saving time. 

P.S: Yes, I had to download some apps just to make a good banner image.
