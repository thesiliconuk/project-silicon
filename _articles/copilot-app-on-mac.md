Copilot has officially launched its app for macOS, making it actually optimized for the platform. The app has a beautiful UI, the same from the website, but much cleaner. Also, just like ChatGPT, the copilot icon can go in the menu bar and there is the same [option space] keyboard shortcut that can previously be used to launch copilot. However, because I ALSO have ChatGPT, I changed my copilot shortcut to [control space] instead, so now, I have cmd space. For spotlight, option space for get and control space for copilot. I also have double click command for apple intelligence, so I now have 3 air at my fingertips. The app still uses the same copilot model, however, I don’t enjoy the fact that you need to be signed in [over 18] to acess chat history, generate images and voice chat. As a person who is currently 12 years old, I think I know very well how to use an AI.
