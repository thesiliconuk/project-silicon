The mini iphone, loved by some, hated by some. 

Apple is reportedly planning to bring back the mini iPhone for 2025, th iPhone 17 mini. There are many reasons for this, including the demand from the public, this makes it a quite obvious decision for Apple to bring it back. Also, the plus model iPhones have not been selling well and Apple thinks a mini iPhone would sell better. Also, there is no competition in the market for small phones so apple would beat the non existent competition. This is really exciting as it is rumored to have a silicon-carbon battery and the C1 nodem probably making it the iPhone with the longest battery life *in history* 

*Are you going to be buying the iPhone 17 Mini?*
