Hi there, I am Badie Badie and in this article I am going to go through what is on my iPhone. 

Hardware:â€¨For Hardware, I have an iPhone 14 Pro, a solid choice for anyone as it has a great camera, alot of years of software support and a great build. The dynamic island is a fundamental part of my life now and also it can pair to my Apple Watch. Also, I am a large iPhone/iOS fan as I have been using it ever since I got a phone and I find it the most secure, fastest experience. For a phone case, I use the nilkin camera guard case for iPhone 14 Pro, one of my favorites as it blends extreme ruggedness with a really clean, minimalist, dark mode design.

**Wallpapers and customization:**

For my wallpaper, I like a minimalist wallpaper as it helps my phone be distraction free, I find that hiding the notifications so it only says the number of notifications instead of the notifications themselves. I have 2 widgets, a Reminders widget and a calendar widget with when my next event is to help me keep on top of my tasks and meetings. I donâ€™t keep anything on the Home Screen shortcuts to carry on with that minimalist look.

For Home Screen, I am a functionality over form person, I have a dark grey background to keep that minimal look, at the top of the first screen is a reminders widget and a countdown widget to Eid which I find pretty cool. Underneath, I put all of my most used apps [Findmy, HabitKit, Apple Sports, App Store, Podcasts, Halifax, WhatsApp, Photos, Perplexity AI, F1 App, Reminders, Maps, Teams, TFL GO, Quran and contacts app] I keep the apps in a dark mode color and with a large so that I have the cleanest look possible. In the dock, I keep Safari, Settings, Mail and iMessage, I feel like those are the apps that I really need to access very frequently as I am always tinkering around in the settings app.

Om the second screen, I have. Large podcasts widgets because I really like listening to podcasts, as you can see, I have recently been watching a 2012 apple event! Underneath, I keep 3 apps, one sec (more about that later)l, Youtube Studio and Crossy road, the only game I play.

My control center took a long time to customize to my preference, I have the basic volume and brightness sliders, then I have my connectivity settings and focus mode. Front and center is a perplexity AI widget to quickly access it. Underneath, I have a bunch of controls and a shortcut to open HabitKit (more about that later)

Inside my widget center, I have just one screen, located here I have two calendar widgets because I like to see when each day falls and the date at a glance. Underneath, I have a battery widget, quite straightforward, a quick way to see the battery of my devices at once, then i have a fitness widget, I like to see how I am doing against my goals and then a reminders widget for the day to see what tasks I need to do. Below, I have a weather widget to quickly see the weather for the day.

**Favourite apps:**

Sure, everyone has their web browser and their messaging apps, but what are the apps that really stand out to me.

First, we have HabitKit, my favorite Habit tracker as it looks like my Github contributions and there is nothing more motivating than looking at your Github contributions filled up so it really makes me do the task I need at hand. 

Secondly, we have an app called OneSec, a screen time manager, what it does is it just prevents you from opening a chosen app by making you do a 5 second to 2minute breathing exercise before you open the app, it also guilt trips you into not opening the app by showing you how many times you attempted to open the app in the last 24 hours.

Those 2 apps above really do help me keep on top of my tasks, and also stop spending too much timer on my phone. If you want to see my reminders app of choice check out our article here!

Another cool app I like to have as a web/graphic designer is the Figma app, here I can just preview all of my latest designs so I can quickly reference to them on the go.
