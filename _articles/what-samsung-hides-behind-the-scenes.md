## The Dark Side of Samsung

*Introduction*

Samsung is one of the largest and most influential technology companies in the world, known for its powerful smartphones, large and high resolution T.Vs, and more. However, behind its success lies a history of ethical controversies, corporate scandals, and questionable business practices. From labor right violations to environmental negligence and corruption, Samsung's darker side has often been overshadowed by its technological achievements. 

*Early Controversies (1990s - 2000s)*

From the beginning of its rise as a global tech giant, Samsung has faced accusations of unethical labor practices. Reports started coming in the late 1990s and early 2000s about the poor working conditions in its factories, particularly in South Korea and China. Workers in semiconductor plants were exposed to toxic chemicals that could have lead to illnesses such as leukemia and cancer which could be fatal. It wasn’t until 2018 that Samsung formally apologized and offered compensation to its affected employees.
During this period, Samsung also gained a bad reputation for an aggressive business tactics.  The company was sued multiple times for allegedly copying designs and technology from competitors like Apple.

*Corporate Scandals and Corruption (2010s)*

During the 2010s, Samsung’s influence grew exponentially, but it also became embroiled in a major corruption scandals. The most infamous case was the bribery scandal involving Samsung’s heir, Lee Jae-yong (Jay Y. Lee). In 2017, he was arrested and convicted for bribing. Though initially sentenced to prison, he was later released on parole in 2021, sparking controversy across the internet over corporate favoritism in South Korea’s judicial system. Samsung faced criticism for its anti-union stance, actively trying to stop workers from forming unions. Documents leaked in 2013 revealed the company’s detailed plans to prevent unionisation, led to legal fights and protests from labor activists. 

*Product and Environmental Issues (2016 - 2020s)*

In 2016, Samsung faced one of its biggest public relations disasters with the Galaxy Note 7 battery explosion crisis. Defective batteries caused the smartphones to catch fire, leading to global recalls and a ban on the device from airlines. The incident not only damaged Samsung’s reputation but also raised concerns about the company’s rushed product development practices which took a severe toll on people who may have used the phone and on the company itself. Environmental concerns also surfaced during this time, with organisations like Greenpeace criticizing Samsung for its slow progress in sustainable manufacturing and e-waste management. The company had been accused of excessive plastic use and lacked a clear recycling program for electronic waste which only further destroyed their reputation.

*Ongoing Ethical Concerns and Market Manipulation (2020s - Present)*

Samsung continues to face ethical concerns, particularly regarding its supply chain. Reports from watchdog organisations, claim that child labor and exploitative practices persist in some of its supplier factories. In addition, Samsung has been caught manipulating benchmark scores to make its devices appear more powerful than they actually are, misleading customers and regulator leading to customers not getting what they expected raising ethical issues once again.

*Conclusion*

Despite these controversies, Samsung still remains a dominant brand in the global technology industry. However, its history of scandals raises questions about the ethical cost of its success. While the company continues to innovate and expand, its past and present actions highlight the need for greater accountability and transparency. Consumers and regulators alike must remain aware of what happens behind the scenes to ensure that technological progress does not come at the expense of ethical business practices.
