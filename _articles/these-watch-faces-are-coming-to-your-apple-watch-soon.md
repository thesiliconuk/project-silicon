So, Apple just wrapped up their jaw dropping event, and while everyone is talking about the new iPhone 17 Air, people failed to spot the first thing at the beginning of the keynote; Apple Watch

Apple announced the new Ultra 3, Series 11 and the SE3 and along with them comes some of the best apple watch faces in history (in my opinion at least)

I honestly think this is one of the best Apple Watch faces EVER! The liquid glass feels modern and sleek and it has beautiful gradient backgrounds based on the colors that you picked. I am really excited to see if the numbers have a cool new animation as each minute goes by and also what the always on display will look like, I feel like this is a great opportunity for apple to make some really good physics in their watch face

Second, my personal favourite, the Apple Watch titanium model, this watch face is much more my vibe, functional but still sleek but not too flashy, just take a look at this beauty:

Is it not stunning? It is really precise and shows the hours, minutes and seconds pass by and has the classic 4 corner complications for quick access to data. I love this watch face and I will definitely be using it, it is just so stunning, I know I keep repeating myself but you have to give this watch face a try when it comes out.

Third, we have the Apple Watch Ultra

Ok, I lied, THIS is my favourite, but I won't get it :/ because the apple watch ultra faces are exclusive to the ultra unfortunately. But this is just, just so good. It has the professional but informative, sleek vibe of the previous one but will look super good on the Ultra's bigger display. It also seems to show a water depth but I think that this will be customisable. It only has 3 corner complications but, it has the compass in the middle which I absolutely loved with previous Ultra faces.

Ohki, theres ONE more watch face but I don't think alot of us will get it and not many people spotted it in the keynote but the Apple Watch Hermes has a new watch face and this one is sooo nice. I don't really know what it is but I think this is the best Hermes face so far, there are also new watch straps but I wont get into those.

I love how this watch face shows off the identity of the Hermes brand while also still looking professional.

You can expect these watch faces with watchOS 26 release which is predicted to be next week. Note that the Ultra and Hermes faces are exclusive to their respective model.
