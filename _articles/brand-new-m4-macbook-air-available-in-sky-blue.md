So there is something in the air today, well 2 things actually, we got the MacBook Air AND the Mac Studio today (find out more about the Mac Studio in another article on here)

Apple released a new color which looks absolutely gorgeous, this being a sky blue, this color is a very light blue and I think it will be very popular as it wonâ€™t show fingerprint (cough, midnight) Sadly, Space Grey (my favorite personally) was removed to accommodate for this new color. Now, I personally think that the starlight is the best color now because yellow is my favourite color and I donâ€™t really like blue to be honest. I feel like the higher end of the market wonâ€™t be buying this color as I just donâ€™t think it gives off that *professional* aesthetic. What excites me is that the blue MagSafe cable will look really nice and I wish we could see blue apple stickers.

Apple reduced the starting price to Â£999 and in turn kicked there M2 AND M3 off of itâ€™s website. I think Â£999 for an M4 is an awesome deal to be honest. Also, it starts at 16GB RAM and still only 256GB Storage. 

What do you think of the new color? Is it good or bad, let us know in the comments below ðŸ‘‡!
