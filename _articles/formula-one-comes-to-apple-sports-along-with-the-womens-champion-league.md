> Calling F1 fans! Follow all the excitement on the track this season with Apple Sports, including live leaderboards, lap times and more.

These were the words of Apple 1 hour ago as they released version 2.6 of their ever growing Apple Sports app, bringing formula one to the app, an addition many people have been waiting for. Along with this, the women’s champion league was also added to the app, fighter diversifying the plethora of sports and leagues inside the app. I think this update will bring all the F1 fans around the world to this app, especially as the first race of the formula one season is this weekend!

As an avid formula one fan myself, I have been waiting for this update for a long time as I always found f1’s official app sort of clunky for managing the race leaderboards. I will probably share screenshots on Saturday and Sunday on how the UI looks and if it stay good [Which it most likely will be!]

This was a short article and we won’t be posting this much articles in the coming weeks as we are working on thecubed and also working on a stepintothenhs project!
