Apple CEO Tim Cook has recently posted on twitter that we should ”be ready to meet the newest member of the family” hinting at a new product coming on Wednesday, February 19th. He also put #AppleLaunch hinting at an actual event…

But what could this be. This will most likely be the up and coming iPhone SE 4, which was rumored to come this week but pushed back to next week. However, it could be the m4 MacBook Air or the iPad 11th generation. However, these aren’t those big of product releases. Looking at the image it appears to be an apple logo with a circle around it. The animation in the middle really reminds me of the iPad Pro wallpaper from last year (the m4 one) but this time in sliver. However, the iPhone SE4 is suspected to come in Black and Silver so we don’t really know.

This article was a short one and was just letting you know about this. Thanks for reading.
