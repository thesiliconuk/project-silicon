You might have missed it but Samsung just released the new Samsung S25 Edge, a phone focused on being thinner and lighter. 

So, what are the specs?

It comes with the same chip from the S25 Ultra series, the latest snapdragon chipset meaning that it doesn’t sacrifice on performance. It boasts the same display panel from the Samsung Galaxy S25+ meaning that the display is not as large as the Ultra but it is still quite large. The build is made from titanium just like the Ultra to make it 163 grams light. It is only 5.88 mm thin meaning that the in hand feel would be very comfortable. However, making the phone thinner does mean that the battery is only a measly 3900mAH meaning that it is significantly less than the rest of the line up, this is really not ideal as the phone will probably not last a day with normal use. It does still have standard wireless charging that supports reverse wiring charging as well. 

Why?

Why did Samsung release it? My take; probably as a separator between the S25+ and Ultra. This phone starts from $1099 which means it is just a bit under the Ultra but still above the plus. This makes it more compelling for users who are wanting a new Samsung phone but don’t want a full on Ultra phone with a pen but they do not want the basic s25+

The competition

We cannot talk about this phone without mentioning the competition, or what’s coming. We all know about the iPhone 17 Air right now, a device coming to the iPhone 17 lineup that is said to be very similar to this s25 edge, thinner and lighter. However, there are no other really thin phones on the market. But I want to talk about the Pixel 9a which has taken an opposite approach and I prefer it. What Google did was give us a cheaper phone, that is thicker and put a gigantum of a battery inside it. This is better because this is what users actually want, lower price, higher battery life. Not the opposite…

What do you think? Is it worth it?
