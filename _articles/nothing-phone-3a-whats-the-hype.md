Nothing has finally showcased the Phone (3a) to the public after weeks of teasing it. Here's a quick summary of everything you need to know:

The Phone (3a) has a fresh new look, with a revamped camera layout which is much more cutting edge than the Phone (2a)'s basic horizontal camera layout. It features a pro level camera system with a 50MP main camera and an impressive 60x periscope lens for the pro model. The Phone (3a) Pro also features the new "Essential Key",  which is an AI powered shortcut which can look at your screen and take information from it. The Phone (3a) also has the powerful Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 which is expected to be faster and more power efficient than the Phone (2a)'s Mediatek Dimensity 7200 Pro. The phone also has 50w charging, a (not so) MASSIVE improvement over the Phone (2a)'s 45w charging.

This is quite a short article due to the development of The Silicon 2.0. However, we are finalising our work on it and hope to see us return to regular publishing schedule within the course of next week.
