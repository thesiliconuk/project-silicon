What is the best reminder app on iPhone, well this article will take a deep dive into what it actually is, I have extensively used all of these and here is what I will be ranking them on:

* UI/UX 
* Cost [If any]
* Cross device compatibility [Including Apple Watch]


Lets start off with my least favourite, Microsoft To Do, don’t get me wrong, this is quite a great app but I feel like the UI is not very ’Microsoft like’ and it just doesn’t follow Microsoft’s design philosophy. I also was never really tied into Microsoft except from the fact that I have an outlook email but I still use the Apple Mail app. I feel like Microsoft To Do also doesn’t have the best UX, it feels clunky and slow at times and I just don’t enjoy using it as much as the other apps on this list. It does have an Apple Watch app but it is even more buggy than the mobile app and it also looks very generic unlike other Microsoft apps, we have seen how well Microsoft did with the new Copilot app for macOS (https://thesilicon.uk/read?a=PKTIMIYalvcJ1ys6pSia) so there is no reason that their other apps should be looking this generic and boring.

Next, we have one that made me quite disappointed… Tick tick, an app that has been praised by alot of people, I feel like it just doesn’t live up to the hype. The UI [though customizable] just feels very cluttered and I don’t enjoy using it, also, it isn’t the most intuitive thing on the planet, try using it and you would understand what I mean, I just feel it is too overkill for a reminders app. Also, most features need the Premium subscription anyways so that isn’t a good thing. I can forgive the subscription because this is the only one on the list not made by a large company.

Next, we have Google Tasks, this app was PERFECT for me, and then I found out that there is no Apple Watch app, this really disappointed me as I was really happy with the mobile app, everything was executed well, this app was nice and simple, no clutter, no mess, just a list of what I needed for the day, but not having it available on the Apple Watch is a MASSIVE missed opportunity, I feel like if they added an Apple Watch version this would be one of my favourite apps.

Now, my personal favourite, Apple Reminders. Sure, I kind of sound like an Apple Sheep now, I said safari was the best browser (https://thesilicon.uk/read?a=hpJaxXvu5u1iJh0XQR1V) and I use an iPhone, MacBook and Apple Watch. But I am not really, I am open to test other products and I don’t use Apple for everything (sort of…) I just feel that Apple has the best integration of Software and Hardware, that’s besides the point. Anyways, the Reminders app is actually perfection, a simple to use UI, very functional but not too cluttered or overwhelming, comes pre-installed on your Mac, Apple Watch and iPhone, they all tie into each other and also, one thing, the app icon isn’t a tick like all the other ones, during testing, I found it hard to distinguish between the apps because I use white tinted icons on my iPhone and I can’t really distinguish between 3 ticks… Also, integration with my calendar app of choice (Apple calendar) makes it easy to organize all my events and tasks. Another plus, interactive widgets on the desktop of my Mac, so whenever I get a task done I can either use my Apple Watch to tick it off, or when I am on my laptop just go to the desktop and tick it off, simple as that!

That’s it for this article.
