Ok, the AI race is on, all the large tech companies are battling each other to see who can make the best AI assistant. Note: Samsungâ€™s Galaxy AI wasnâ€™t included in this battle because none of us writers have access to it. Also, to note, Apple Intelligence is fairly new so it probably wonâ€™t be able to compete with the others, ok , the race is on!

But before we start lets head into the scoring system:â€¨Wrong answer or failure to comply: 0 points
Basic answer, one sentence: 1 point
In depth, detailed answer: 2 points
Exceptional answer: 3 points [an exceptional answer is one that you take surprise by (we wonâ€™t see many of them)]


Ok, for the first question we have: What is the Capital of China?
All AIâ€™s answered correctly however I think Gemini and Copilot take the cake here because they provided more detailed answers, here is a deeper look: 
Copilotâ€™s response: The capital of China is Beijing. It's a city steeped in history, with landmarks such as the Forbidden City and the Great Wall, as well as being a bustling modern metropolis. Is there something specific you want to know about Beijing? ðŸ˜Š
Geminiâ€™s response: The capital of China is Beijing. It's a huge city with a lot to see, like the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square.
The other Aiâ€™s responded with a plain, one sentence answer, all correctly, however, I think ChatGPT deserves half a point more because it put the actual answer in BOLD and also, Apple Intelligence got a picture however, it used wikipedia so I dont think that counts.

Here is the current leaderboard:
Copilot: 2
Gemini: 2
ChatGPT: 1.5
Apple Intelligence: 1
Deepseek: 1

Next question now, it is going to be a follow up question (how large is it?)
Now this one was interesting, all the Aiâ€™s apart from Appleâ€™s gave quite an in-depth response here they are:
Copilot: Beijing is quite expansive! Covering around 16,410 square kilometers (approximately 6,336 square miles), it's not just the political capital but also a major hub for culture, education, and technology. This vast city is home to over 21 million people. Have you ever visited Beijing, or are you planning a trip there?
Deepseek: Beijing, the capital of China, is a vast metropolis covering an area of approximately **16,410.5 square kilometers (6,336.1 square miles)**. It is one of the most populous cities in the world, with over **21 million residents** as of recent estimates. The city is not only China's political and cultural center but also a major hub for education, technology, and international diplomacy. Its size and population make it a key global city.
Gemini: Beijing is a huge city!  It covers an area of about 6,500 square miles, which is about the size of the state of Connecticut. It's home to over 21 million people, making it one of the most populous cities in the world.
ChatGPT: Beijing covers an area of about 16,410.5 square kilometers (6,336.1 square miles), making it one of the largest cities in the world by land area. It has a population of approximately 21 million people.
And then we have the disappointing response from Apple Intelligence: giving a plain number, no more.

Here is the point grab for this round:
Copilot 5(+3) This was indeed an exceptional answer, it gave a more friendly tone, making it seem more personal and also asked a question at the end
Gemini: 4(+2)
ChatGPT: 3.5 
Deepseek: 3 (+2)
Apple Intelligence: 2 (+1)

We dont have much time left now for writing, stay tuned for part 2b, coming tomorrow most likely
