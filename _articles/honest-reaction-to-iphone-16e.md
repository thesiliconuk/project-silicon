Honestly, we were all really hyped for the up and coming iPhone SE 4. However, in our opinion, here at thesilicon, we think they have done it ALL WRONG. Firstly, they branded it as iPhone 16E making people veer away from the normal iPhone 16 because it caries the 16 marketing and that is the best of the worst. 

They included the notch which is very confusing because there is the action button but the action button is a newer feature so I don’t know what they were thinking there. 

THEY PRICED IT AT £599. This is the largest turn off, paying £599 for a phone that has one camera isn’t something we should be seeing in 2025, not to mention it has a 60Hz display. 

The marketing is horrible, the marketing is really bad, and apple is normally quite good at marketing, however, they made it centric around iOS features, yes, Apple intelligence is a good thing, but it isn’t a necessity, you know what is a necessity? 120hz! Also, Apple carried on talking about some things that you would expect, like the passwords app and airdrop, these are basic apple features, not something locked to the iPhone 16e. They also kept saying the most ”affordable member of the iPhone 16 family”. I think apple is in an identity crisis with the iPhone 16 lineup because all the phones are WILDLY different (in price and features)

The C1 chip is interesting and apple is saying ”the efficiency of C1 will give iPhone 16e the best battery life on a 6.1”iPhone” So the £200 more iPhone 16 has a worse battery?? And, Apple, very sadly, got rid of the Product Red, my personal favourite iPhone color EVER (after natural titanium) This means you can no longer buy a red iPhone directly from apple. Also, the iPhone 16 e will support MagSafe and it will have USBC, but Apple was making the introduction of USBC some sort of thing that they invented themselves saying ”you can connect all your devices with one cable” Well, THAT IS WHY THE EU FORCED YOU TO USE IT


I am sorry if this article seemed very unprofessional but this was done in a hurry (because I am currently designing thesilicon 2.0 and I am also super disappointed with this release)
