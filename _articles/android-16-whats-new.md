Google just had their Android Show, where they unveiled new features and introduced an updated design.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dc5w3cjmh/image/upload/v1747158382/Articles/android-16---whats-new/n7fczoitxxi5mkxthwd0.webp) Android 16 features a fresh new look that Google are calling Material 3 Expressive. It features a frosted blur design reminiscent to visionOS, with the UI elements themed to the wallpaper of the device. Material 3 Expressive also introduces animations with a new motion physics engine and a more natural and intuitive design, with attention to detail being a huge focus. We also see a new Quick Settings panel, with customisable tiles that can be resized and rearranged to suit your needs. Google put a **massive** emphasis on battery efficiency of the new design, saying that the motion physics engine will not effect battery life.

Gemini has also gotten a big update, with Android powered watches, TVs, Android XR and cars getting the assistant. You can now share your screen or camera to Gemini and ask questions about the info presented to it. Gemini can now also summarise messages on wearOS, similar to Apple Intelligence.

Google has also introduced some new security features, such as embedded trackers on luggage and the ability to share luggage data with airlines. Google has also renamed the Find Devices app to Find Hub.

Next week, at Google IO, we are anticipating the Android XR, a VR headset that was made through a collaboration with Google and Samsung. We are also expecting more features and updates to Gemini.
