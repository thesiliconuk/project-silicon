*Introduction*

If you have WhatsApp, you will have noticed that, in the past few weeks, a new AI feature has been launched: Meta AI. However, this launch has been controversial, as there is no way you can switch the feature off, at least not yet. So in this article, we will dive into Meta AIâ€™s controversy.

*The Purpose*

The purpose of Meta AI is clear, to a certain extent. WhatsApp says that you can use it to ask questions, just like with any other AI. But, a lot of people argue that there is no point to having an AI on a social media platform; surely you are there to talk with friends, and not AI? But, either way, you can ask Meta AI questions you would ask any other AI chatbot (such as Apple Intelligence and Gemini.)

*How well it works*

Unfortunately, Meta AI does not seem to be as good at giving answers to questions as well as ChatGPT, but it still is good at handling simpler tasks. 

*Can I switch it off?*

Like with any WhatsApp chat, you can delete the chatbot, but you can't seem to switch off the AI suggestions that Meta AI makes. 

*Controversy*

Many dislike the thought of having an AI that they can't properly switch off, which is why many do not like the introduction of Meta AI on WhatsApp. I myself feel uneasy at the thought of an AI chatbot I can't switch off.
