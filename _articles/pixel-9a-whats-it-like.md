***Introduction***

In the last few days, Google has released their newest mid rangphone, the Pixel 9a. This phone features a big redesign, as Google has removed the camera bar. But, looks aside, is the Pixel 9a worth it?

***The Camera Bar***

The biggest visible change is how the phone has no camera bar. I myself am not too sure whether I like it or not, as, in the past, the camera bar made the Pixel Phone a Pixel Phone.

***Processor and Battery***
 
The Google Pixel 9a is equipped with the Tensor G4 chip, and the Titan M2 Security chip, the same as its big brother, the Pixel 9. It also has an absolutely amazing 30+ hours of battery life, and up to 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver! However, the Pixel 9a does not include Battery Share. For those of you who don't know, Battery Share enables you to charge other phones wirelessly from your phone. For the record, I have used this a couple of times whilst using my Pixel 8.

***Camera***

Pixel Phones have always had a brilliant reputation for the camera system, and the Pixel 9a is no exception. It contains Macro Focus, which the previous Pixel 8a does not have, and a 48mp camera and 13mp ultra wide camera. Will the camera be a good one? Only time will tell.

***Display***

The Pixel 9a has a 6.3 Inch Actua Display, a step up from the previous Pixel 8a. It has a slightly smaller peak brightness than the 9, being 2,700 nits compared to the pixel 9’s 3,000. It also includes Smooth Display, allowing the display to increase its refresh rate up to 120Hz. Many people complained about the Pixel 8a because of its large bezels; well, this year, the bezels are even all the way around the 9a.

***Software***

The Pixel 9a will be shipped with Android 15, and will also include Google Gemini as the built-in assistant. It will also include almost all of the photo editing features available on the Pixel 9, but does not include Action Pan. Like with most Pixels, the phone is shipped with free Google VPN.

***Colours and Looks***

The Google Pixel 9a is available in the following colours: Peony, Iris, Porcelain and Obsidian. These colours equip the phone with a bright and bold look. The phone is made from recycled materials, so it is more environmentally friendly than some other competitors. 

***Verdict***

For the price, the Pixel 9a is a brilliant value for money. If you are looking for a modern phone with great performance at a ‘mid range’ price, the Pixel 9a will be brilliant for you. However, if you want amazing and flawless performance and price is no worry, I would recommend the Pixel 9 or Pixel 9 Pro.
