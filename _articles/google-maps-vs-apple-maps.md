Introduction

I use a Google Pixel 8, which runs on Android, and for school, I use an iPad Air 5, which runs on iPadOS. I know that this is a big clash between operating systems! But I want to focus on the similarities: how do the photo apps compare? How do the maps compare? This is the start of a series comparing Apple's core apps and Android's core apps, and today, we will be comparing Apple Maps and Google Maps!

What's the difference?

The biggest difference is the layout and design. The logo of Apple Maps suggests that its main purpose is navigation. Google Maps' logo is a location pinpoint, which suggests that it focuses on location.

How do they compare?

To start, we're going to see what features they have and how accessible they are.

Does it have street view? (In Great Britain)

Google Maps: Yes (1 point)
Apple Maps: Yes (1 point)

What is the span of the street view?

Google Maps: Almost everywhere (2 points)
Apple Maps: Restricted to major cities (1 point)

Does it have 3D?

Google Maps: Yes (1 point)
Apple Maps: Yes (1 point)

Detail of 3D

Google Maps: 3
Apple Maps: 5

Does it have a measure tool?

Google Maps: Yes (1 point)
Apple Maps: No (0 points)


Total: 
Google Maps: 8 points
Apple Maps: 8 points.


From this, we can see that both apps have a good variety of features; Apple Maps is better in the sense of detail and Google Maps is better in the sense of a wider range of features. 

What is more practical?

Moving on from the last round, where it was just features and specs, we are now going to see which one actually helps you in your day to day life.

‘Home’ and ‘Work.’
 When it comes to the app knowing    
 where your home or place of work   
 is, they both ace it, so in this area,   
 it's a tie.

Google Maps: 1 Point 
            Apple Maps: 1 Point

Navigation
            When it comes to navigation, both      
            deliver a brilliant service. However,     
            there is one thing Google Maps 
            better: it tells/predicts what the most 
            fuel efficient route is; a very cool  
            feature, that helps preserve petrol 
            and helps the planet.
            
            Google Maps: 5 points
            Apple Maps: 4 points
           
            
Total Points:
Google Maps: 14 points
Apple Maps: 13 points


Special Features

A relatively new feature has been brought into Google Maps; Immersive view. It is a really cool 3D feature that focuses on a a specific landmark, like St Paul's Cathedral. I think this is to make up for the lack of accurate 3D representation in satellite view, but either way it is very good!

As mentioned before, Apple Maps has a brilliant 3D mode, which is extremely accurate and detailed. Also, Apple have a brilliant ecosystem, which really does enhance Apple Maps; when you start a route on your phone, your Apple Watch will also give you directions! This is yet another brilliant example of Apple’s subtle, yet amazing features!


Conclusion

As we can see, both Google Maps and a
Apple Maps have excellent features, it just depends on your personal preferences. So, in this case, it is six of one and half a dozen of the other. Join us again for another Google Vs Apple test on Monday!
