Andâ€¦

â€¦they didnâ€™t change the name :|

The new, top of the line, shiny SONY WH-1000 XM6 over ear headphones have just been revealed and they have taken the already brilliant XM5 and built on top of them to make them even better.
So what has changed? Well, letâ€™s hear (see what I did there ðŸ˜‰) what itâ€™s all about!â€¨
Design:

Sony have slightly updated the design due to a few complaints about the XM5. They have added the ability to fold them neatly back up again along with a beautiful new case which is a lot smaller than previous generation. They have also added back the ability to rotate the ear cups to a more comfortable position when sitting on your shoulders. The new case is really great as it gets rid of the zipper and instead comes with a magnetic clasp which is a lot faster and also very satisfying. They have also increased the size of the power button for easier accessibility. They have kept the overall hardware design with the iconic wh-1000 XM style of headphones. 

Sound quality:

Well, I canâ€™t judge it my self as I have never listened to them. However, judging from reviews by notable creators such as Marques Brownlee, Carterpcs, ShortCircuit and more, it can be said that the sound quality is a massive leap up from the previous generation, improving the transparency mode by a significant amount. 

Price:

Now, when you make the best product, you can price it at whatever you want. Apple sure does it so why doesnâ€™t SONY? They have upped the price of the XM6 by $49 making it sit at $449 now. However, I personally think that this is still a really good price. This is because there are no competitors offering the same feature set with the elegant design and excellent sound quality over ear headphones. This is because competitors like the AirPods Max and Beats Studio are not even close to this level of sound quality. 

Conclusion:â€¨
Overall, it is a nice refresh with better sound quality and a better design, will you be buying it? Let us know below ðŸ‘‡
