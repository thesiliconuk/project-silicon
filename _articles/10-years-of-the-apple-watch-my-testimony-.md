10 years, today marks 10 years since you could buy an Apple Watch Series 0. Appleâ€™s most â€™personal device everâ€™, the first major product that apple released since Steve Jobs passing in 2011. The Apple Watch has gone through alot of updates and changes but the core principle remains the same, fitness. The Apple Watch has always been a fitness device, aimed to motivate you to move, stand and exercise more with the exercise rings. 

I got my first Apple Watch in 2023, the Apple watch series 9 in midnight. I was already wearing a Fitbit charge 5 for fitness purposes but the Apple Watch was changing. I started working out more. There are 2 factors that really motivated me to start exercising more:

First, it is activity sharing, knowing that someone can just look at my activity for the day makes me more motivated to move. Also, competing in competitions can really inspire you to start moving. 

Secondly, you have the badges, especially the limited edition ones, I am a person who will do anything for a limited edition product, so getting the limited edition badges motivates you to different workouts or workout more. 

The Apple Watch has honestly changed me and I really recommend one to anyone using an iPhone. If you are using an Android you have alot more choices, you could go for a Pixel watch, Galaxy watch or even a Garmin. Another option you do have is a smart ring. Today, was the 10th year anniversary.

Because this was the 10th anniversary, there was another limited edition bade, all you had to do was close all three rings, see how this motivates you. After you have done this, you get the badge inside the fitness app and also limited edition iMessage stickers. Now, the highlight of the day, you can walk into an Apple Store and pick yourself up a pin for ðŸ†“. Of course, I got one and here it is:

It resembles the badge that I unlocked inside the fitness app and it is stunning. 

Thank you for reading this article, make sure to close your rings!
