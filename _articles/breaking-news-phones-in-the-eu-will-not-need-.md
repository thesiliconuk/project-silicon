In the very near future, your new phone might not have a USB-C Port, or any charging port at all! This is because the EU have stated that if a phone supports wireless charging, it does not need to be shipped with a charging port, provided their is a wireless alternative.


This could have a big impact on both Apple and Samsung, who are expected to release their thinnest phones later this year: the iPhone 17 Air and the Samsung S25 Edge. 

So, the design of phones in just a few years down the line looks to be very different to what we have now, will the prices of phones go sky high, or will they go down? Only time will tell!
