Tim cook recently posted a tweet on twitter/X stating that there is something coming ”this week”. Attached is a video saying ”there is something in the air”, this makes us speculate that it could be an iPad/MacBook Air. However, what posts out at the fact that it will most likely be a MacBook Air (m4), is the fact that the slogan ”there is something in the AIR” was used in 2008 for the release of the OG MacBook Air
