*Breaking News*

The release of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is expected to be at 01:00 (BST) tomorrow morning.  Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide live coverage for this event. But, we will be bringing you details on this event tomorrow, by 16:00 (BST.)

*What we expect*

We expect the S25 Edge to be the thinnest phone Samsung have made yet. It will also feature a 6.6 Inch display, as well as the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip at the heart of the phone. We are also expecting the phone to feature a titanium frame, so durability will be a lot better. At the back of the phone, we expect two cameras, with a rather large resolution.
