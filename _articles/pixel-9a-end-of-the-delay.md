***Introduction***

The Pixel 9a has been much anticipated for a while, and about a week ago, it was released. But now, there are rumors that it has now been delayed.

***Why is the Pixel 9a delayed?***

The Pixel 9a has been delayed because Google felt that one of the components did not meet their quality standards. Of course, Google have not specified exactly what the problem was, so we can only guess.

***When will the delay end?***

The delay looks as though it will end within the next couple of days, so you should be able to buy the fresh, new Pixel 9a very soon!
