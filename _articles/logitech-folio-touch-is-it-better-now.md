*Introduction*

About two months ago, I did an article on the Logitech Folio Touch, and came to the conclusion that it wasn't the best of cases for your iPad and that you should get the Logitech Combo Touch instead. But, since then, Logitech sent me a replacement, and a few things have changed… 

*Context*

I bought the Logitech Folio Touch just under a year ago, and it seemed brilliant, but over time, it started to deteriorate. So I contacted Logitech, and I was relieved to hear that it was still in the warranty period, so they sent me a new one. I must admit, I was not very pleased to hear that I would be getting another Folio Touch, as I thought I would end up with the same problems in about a year or so. But, upon receiving it, my thoughts changed. 

*Amendments* 

The first thing I realised was that it was a lot lighter than the previous Folio Touch, but it was still protective so carrying it around is a lot easier. I also noticed that the power buttons had changed; they have a ‘plus’ and ‘minus’ as opposed to the ‘button’ style. The case also seems to fit the iPad a lot better. On top of this, the texture of the case feels different compared to the previous model; it doesn't feel exactly like ‘fabric’ and is therefore more durable. 

*Final Thoughts*

Now that Logitech have amended the case, I would recommend the Folio Touch if you don't want the detachable keyboard style that the Combo Touch has. The Folio Touch has been made lighter, and has had several other improvements which make it a better user experience.
