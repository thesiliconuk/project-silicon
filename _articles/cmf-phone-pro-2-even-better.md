*Introduction*

In this day and age, a lot of phones look similar to someone who does not stay up-to-date with the latest technology, but one exception to this is CMF and Nothing. The CMF Pro 2 was released yesterday (6th May) and has received a lot of positive reviews already. In this article we will go over the specs and whether you should buy this particular phone. 

*Design*

CMF have always had good designs, in my opinion at least, whether it's their watches or phones. But this year's design takes it to the next level, and as said in the introduction, it really stands out, and in a positive way. It comes in a range of four different colours, those being:

Orange
Light Green
Black
Silver

All of these colours are really striking, and equip the phone with a bold look. The camera design has stayed pretty much the same, but you cannot miss the small addition of an extra camera, which we will get onto later. Other than the changes listed above, there are no other major design changes to the phone.

*Performance*

The CMF Phone Pro 2 is equipped with the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro 5G processor, which is a brilliant balance between performance, efficiency and affordability. It also has eight cores. 

*Battery*

The battery on the CMF Phone Pro 2 is yet again a good balance of affordability  and efficiency, with a size of 5,000 mAh and 33W charging, meaning you don't need to worry about your phone running out of battery on a day out!

*Camera*

The CMF Phone Pro 2 also has a brilliant camera system, with a 50 mp main camera, 8 mp ultra wide camera, a 16 mp front camera and a 50 mp telephoto camera. Yes, that's right, CMF have added telephoto.  The camera is also equipped with Ultra XDR.

*Display*

The display on this phone is 6.77”, a step up from the 6.67” display of the 1 Pro. Some may say that this is not a ‘good’ upgrade and they would sooner have a smaller screen, but, at this price point, you really can't complain. The phone has a Flexible AMOLED display, a step up, from the previous phone. The phone also has a refresh rate of up to 120hz. 

*Conclusion*

The CMF Phone Pro 2 is a brilliant phone, particularly at this price point, and I would recommend it, if you are looking for a change in software, or you just want a phone that will do the basics, superbly. The CMF Phone Pro 2 is available to buy for £249 and we have left a link for it in the description.
