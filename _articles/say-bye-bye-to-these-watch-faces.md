Say bye bye to the following watch faces





1. Fire and Water

2. Liquid Metal

3. Toy Story

4. Gradient

5. Vapor





Apple has decided to make the decision to remove these watch faces for no apparent reason. Last year, they did remove the Siri watch face but that was because it was replaced by the Smart Stack. These watch faces don’t seem to have a reason for being removed, they just got removed. I am particularly sad about the ’Gradient’ watch face because it really is one of the most beautiful watch faces we have had. Apple will most likely release new watch faces in September with the new Apple Watch per usual. 





Are you sad to see them go? Let us know below
