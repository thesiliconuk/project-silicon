Got an iPhone and listen to podcasts? I think this might be the perfect app for you:

[](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/queue-simple-podcasts/id6639586996)

Queue is a podcast app only for iPhone and it has a really beautiful user interface while still being intuitive to use. As the description states, it is just a simple auto-updating Queue. Queue makes it surprising easy to listen to all your favourite podcasts, offering transcripts and video when possible. Another cool feature, is the ’insights’ showing you how long you have spent listening to your favourite podcasts however, you can only get that with the ’Pro version’ which goes for £4.99 a month or £29.99 a year which I think is a great deal considering how much time I spend listening to podcasts. 

This is our first publication of App Tuesday, a series where we will mention great apps and hidden gems that we know you will enjoy!
