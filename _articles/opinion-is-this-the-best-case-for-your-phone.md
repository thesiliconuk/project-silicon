***Introduction***
Almost everyone finds buying a new phone exciting, however, I really like finding the right case for my new phone. After all, the case is what you physically interact with on a daily basis. But, for many, this area of accessories is most definitely overlooked. But, I think I have found one of the best cases for my phone and potentially yours as well. 
*For reference, I used a Google Pixel 8 to text the case.*

***What does it do?***

In my opinion, the Caseology Nano Pop is one of the best cases, if not the best case for your phone. It offers a mix of sleek minimalism and protection, ensuring your phone is protected from every day drops. The case is slim and does not add that much weight to the phone, making it a real plus for those who don't like heavy or chunky gadgets.

***Design***

The Caseology Nano Pop comes in several different colours, depending on what phone you have. However, as a minimum, it has Sesame Black and Blueberry Yellow. There are several other colours available though. The Caseology Nano Pop features a two-colour design, with (in the case of Blueberry Yellow) yellow on the camera bar and blue everywhere else. It really makes the phone stand out, as well as giving a pop style to your phone.

***Durability***

As far as durability is concerned, the Caseology Nano Pop has no trouble whatsoever. The case still feels the same as it did when it was bought 5 months ago. However, I have noticed some scratches on the back of the case, but this is just wear and tear, especially considering that I have been using it for 5 months. The case does not really catch fingerprints, I have only had to wipe it down to get rid of fingerprints once in my time using it.

***Protection***

I consider myself to be careful with my belongings in general, and therefore do not really drop my phone. However, there have been a couple of occasions where I have dropped it, but the Caseology Nano Pop saved it. Aside from dust marks that were easily rubbed off, there were no marks to the case whatsoever, and more importantly, no damage to the phone done at all. 

***Conclusion*** 

The Caseology Nano Pop is a fantastic case, making your phone stand out from the crowd with its unique colour options. It also offers a slim, protective design, ensuring your phone stays protected and light all the time. To conclude, I would really recommend the Caseology Nano Pop to anyone, it is an amazing case!
