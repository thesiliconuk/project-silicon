Apple just released macOS15.4 today and there are many new features including:


* A redesigned Mail app
* 8 New emojis
* Sketch style in Image Playground
* Proximity pairing with iPhone
* And also new Podcast widgets


Some users have seen the lack of the â€™Priority Notification featureâ€™ which came to iOS 18.4 We are hoping to see a macOS version of this in the coming updates as I think it is pretty cool. Now, something that has been looked over is a new wallpaper.

If you have installed this update, you can head into the settings app and under Wallpapers>Photos you will find the â€™Radial Sky Blueâ€™ wallpaper, not to be mixed with the â€™Radial Blueâ€™ which is meant for the midnight MacBook airs. I really do like this wallpaper as it looks absolutely stunning in my opinion. 

Are you going to be using this wallpaper? Let us know below ðŸ‘‡
