The Palette watch face, one of my personal favorites

Introduced with the Apple Watch series 9, the Palette watch face quickly became a favourite among the community for itâ€™s really clean and minimal style (however, it wasnâ€™t as loved as the snoopy watch face ;) )

I feel like this watch face is one of the most useful as you get the ability to have 4 complications along with that really minimal, clean design. It has been one of my most used watch faces and was the one that came stock on my Apple Watch series 9 when I bought it on release. Itâ€™s also the watch face that was prominent on all the marketing and packaging of the Apple Watch S9. I will soon be making an in depth article into all of my tech products, including my iPhone, MacBook and Apple Watch so stay tuned. 

To get this watch face it is really simple. Scroll down until you reach the letter â€™Pâ€™ and click â€™Addâ€™ on the Palette watch face:

This watch face is the perfect bend between timeless, classic and modern.
