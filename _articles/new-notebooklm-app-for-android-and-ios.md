Google just released an app for NotebookLM on the Play Store and the App Store. 





Google NotebookLM is an AI-powered research and note-taking tool developed by Google Labs, designed to help users efficiently process, organize, and gain insights from their own documents and notes. Unlike general-purpose AI chatbots, NotebookLM is specifically grounded in the materials you upload—such as PDFs and websites—ensuring its responses are directly tied to your chosen sources rather than generic internet knowledge.





What are the use cases??





Summarization and Q&A: The tool can quickly summarize lengthy documents, highlight key points, and answer specific questions about your content. You can also ask questions about the provided source. 





Audio: It can generate ”podcast style” summaries of your documents, perfect for those who prefer audio. 





Collaboration: Notebooks can be shared, enabling teams to collaborate, contribute, and organize research together in real time.





Organization: You can create, save, and organize notes, transform them into outlines, study guides, or summaries, and even generate timelines and FAQs from their materials.





Advantages:





It is source-based. It will not ’hallucinate’ meaning that it only gathers info from the provided sources. It will not go out into the wider internet and search for results and you can add up to 50 sources per note. 





Disadvantages:

It’s advantage, is also it’s disadvantage. It cannot go out into the wider internet and source info. This means it is 99% ONLY from the sources YOU provided. This means that the sources you provide must have the information anyway. 





Will I be using it?

Personally, no. I don’t see a reason I should use it because, even as a student, I am not really analyzing documents very often and I feel sending my documents to ChatGPT is easier because of the better UI and the ability to go out into the internet to gather even more info.
