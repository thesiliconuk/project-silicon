WWDC25 is just around the corner and we are all hyped to see what Apple has in store for us‚Ä¶





So, what can we expect?¬†





Per usual, we will receive updates to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, homeOS, tvOS, visionOS and watchOS. But we may see some hardware released this year‚Ä¶





**New HomePod/HomePad**





Ok, hear me out. New homepad/homepod will come out this WWDC. You heard it here first. Because the HomePod is based _around_ Siri which means it should receive Apple Intelligence. Also, they may be releasing a product similar to the Google Nest Hub, the HomePad. The HomePad is rumored to have an iPad mini sized display and be able to control your smart home and do other things like talk to Apple Intelligence to set timers, calendars events and reminders.¬†





**iOS**





Probably the star of WWDC this year. iOS is rumored to have the largest redesign in YEARS [since iOS 7]. The overall design of iOS hasn‚Äôt changed since iOS 7 back with the iPhone 6. Now, we are rumored to get a visionOS style design. Also, if you look at the 3 latest Apple apps; Invites, Sports and Photos. These 3 apps have a really glassmorphic design. Also, another thing is, Apple‚Äôs two latest softwares; watchOS and visionOS both star circular icons making me quite confident that we will receive circular icons, or at least the option to switch to circular icons.¬†





**iPadOS**





iPadOS is rumored to get a more ‚ÄôMacOS‚Äô design including a menu bar and a revamped stage manager. It will very closely resemble macOS and it will be optimized for finger. Previous features will be probably only be available on M-series iPads connected to the Magic Keyboard¬†





**macOS?**





We haven‚Äôt got a new macOS design since Big Sur. Many are speculating that we will get a glassy design to be consistent with Vision Pro and the new iOS and iPadOS. This would look really cool but I don‚Äôt think the changes will be _as drastic_ as iOS and iPad OS





**visionOS 3**





visionOS 3 is rumored to get one new feature. There ability to scroll with your eyes üëÄ, making the experience even more seamless.¬†









**Apple intelligence???**





People are saying that Apple will let third parties access Apple Intelligence so it won‚Äôt stay behind the other companies for ‚ôæÔ∏è. This would be good so Apple Intelligence can be boosted by third parties to make it somewhat useful compared to the hot steaming pile of garbage it is right now.¬†









Keep in mind, these are all just rumors. We will post an article explaining all of the things released as SOON as they are. Make sure to visit daily to see more tech news!
