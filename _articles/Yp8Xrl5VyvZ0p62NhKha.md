***Introduction**

Only a couple of years ago, the EU banned the Lightning Cable, so all phones would use USB-C. Now, they are in the process of letting phone companies ship phones without a charging port at all! Provided, of course that the phone supports wireless charging.

***Will it work?**

Indeed, making the wireless charging speeds will cost more money, but by removing the USB-C port, money will be saved, therefore cancelling out. But, the companies will have to ship wireless chargers with the phone, potentially making the box of the phone larger, and therefore pushing the price up slightly. However, there are many pros of using wireless chargers, one being that they last longer than charging cables, as they do not get damaged as easily. So, yes, removing the USB-C port and replacing it with better wireless charging could be achieved, whether it is better is another question.

***Practicality**

Many people do criticise the practicality of 'carrying a wireless charger around all day.' But, most phones do have the capacity to get you through one day, so you wouldn't really carry a wireless charger around with you all the time. As well as this, many places do have wireless chargers available, such as trains and coaches. 

***Conclusion**

Abandoning the charging port on phones does sound extreme to some, but to others it will be a welcome change.  To me, I would quite like it if my next phone only supported wireless charging, as I would not have to worry about damaged charging cables, if you get what I mean!
