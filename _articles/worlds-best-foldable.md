Get ready for the world’s thinnest book-style foldable smartphone, the Oppo Find N5! It’s set to hit the shelves globally on February 20, 2025, and it’s going to change the game.

Design and Display

The Find N5 is a beauty. It’s super slim, measuring just 4.2 mm when unfolded. And guess what? The display crease is almost invisible, so you’ll get a seamless viewing experience. It’ll be available in Satin Black and Jade White, and there’s even a special Dusk Purple vegan leather edition in China.

Performance and Specifications

Under the hood, the Find N5 is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, so it’s got all the power you need to handle anything you throw at it. It’s got a 6.85-inch LTPO display with 2K resolution and a super fast refresh rate, so you’ll never miss a beat. And there’s even a rumor that it might have up to 16GB of RAM, which is insane!

Camera and Battery

Photography lovers will be in heaven with the Find N5’s triple Hasselblad camera setup. It’s got a periscope telephoto lens for those epic zoom shots. And the battery? It’s got a whopping 6,000mAh capacity, so you can power through your day without worrying about running out of juice. Plus, it supports 80W wired charging, so you can get a quick power-up in no time.

Durability and Water Resistance

The Find N5 may be slim, but it’s built to last. Oppo used titanium for the hinge and aluminum for the frame, so it’s super sturdy. And guess what? It’s water-resistant too! It’s got IPX6, IPX8, and IPX9 ratings, so you can take it on any adventure without worrying about it getting wet.

Global Availability

The Find N5 is going to be available in every country in the world, which is a huge deal for Oppo. The global launch event is happening in Singapore on February 20, 2025, so mark your calendars!  

Oppo’s Find N5 is a game-changer in the foldable phone world. It’s got all the latest tech and a super cool design that’s tough as nails.

This was a quick again, because we don't know much as their global launch event is on the 20th February. Mark your calendars!
