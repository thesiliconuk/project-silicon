Welcome back! Havenâ€™t seen you in a while, sorry about that but weâ€™re back with watch face Wednesday! 

Todayâ€™s watch face is one that is very much utility based, it is aimed to get you all of your info at a quick glance. I am sure many of you can already tell that I am talking about the Modular watch face.



This watch face can blend a timeless design with absolute functionality, something that I really like and that I also portrayed well in my latest wallpaper pack, called design. You can check it out at badiestudios.gumroad.com 



There are 4 different modular watch faces, Nike Compact, Modular Compact, Modular Duo and Modular. There is also Modular Ultra which is only available on the Apple Watch Ultra. My favourite of the bunch is probably modular duo as you get to have 2 large widgets to display all of your information as large as possible. One thing that I really like about the modular watch faces is the fact that they are very resemblant of Casio watches as they too have lots of complications. 

This watch face can look perfect in any scenario, if you are aiming for a more sporty look, you can turn on the background color and choose a bright color, if you want a formal, professional look, you can turn of there background color and have grey accents. This watch face will be able to be used by anyone and they can find the style that they like. 


Will you be using this watch face? Let us know in the comments below ðŸ‘‡!
