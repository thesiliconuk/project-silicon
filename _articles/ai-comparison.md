This is the first part of a multi-part series where we battle the best AI on the market against each other, apple intelligence vs deepseek vs gemini vs chatGPT vs copilot. This is a battle never seen before and we are proud to say that we, at thesilicon are the first to do an extensive comparison of all of these Ai’s. This part will cover a broad overview of each AI ready for the second round where we ask them questions and tasks to see how they compare. Let’s dive right in!

First, we will give some background information on each AI.

DeepSeek: 
This is the AI gaining most traction right now DeepSeek is a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, officially known as Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Basic Technology Research Co., Ltd. Founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, the company operates as a subsidiary of the hedge fund High-Flyer.  However, when the new O1 model was released it sky-rocketed to number 1 in the iOS charts, outscoring ChatGPT.  This is mainly because the O1 model scores nearly as good as ChatGPT’s R1 model but it is free, open-source and more power efficient. Or is it? We will be testing that in Part 2 so stay tuned!

Gemini:
Google Gemini is a family of advanced AI models developed by Google DeepMind, designed to compete with OpenAI’s GPT models. Launched in December 2023, Gemini models are multimodal, meaning they can process and generate text, images, audio, video, and code. The first version, Gemini 1, was followed by Gemini 1.5 in February 2024 and finally, it’s most capable model Gemini 2.0 in December 2024, offering improved efficiency and long-context understanding.

Gemini powers various Google products, including Search, Bard (Google’s AI chatbot), and Workspace applications. The models are available in different versions, from lightweight mobile-friendly models to powerful cloud-based versions for enterprise use. Google continues refining Gemini with a focus on performance, safety, and real-world applications

ChatGPT:
ChatGPT is an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI, based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language model. First launched in November 2022, it quickly became popular for its ability to generate human-like text, assist with various tasks, and engage in natural conversations.

Over time, OpenAI has released multiple versions, including GPT-4 and GPT-4o, improving speed, accuracy, and multimodal capabilities (text, images, and code). ChatGPT is widely used for content creation, coding assistance, education, and customer support. It is available through OpenAI’s web app, mobile apps, and integration with tools like Microsoft Copilot.

Copilot: 
Microsoft Copilot is an AI-powered assistant developed by Microsoft, integrated into various products like Windows, Microsoft 365, and Edge. It leverages OpenAI’s GPT models to enhance productivity by assisting with tasks such as writing, coding, summarizing content, and automating workflows.

Copilot is embedded in apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Virtual Studio Code helping users generate text, analyze data, and create presentations efficiently. It also functions as a chatbot within Windows 11, providing system assistance and general AI capabilities. Microsoft continues to expand Copilot’s features, making it a key part of its AI-driven ecosystem. 
Despite a lot of marketing, this AI has struggled to gain traction in the modern world, however it is exactly what Power Users are looking for, as this is probably the most capable AI model as we will see in Part 2.

Apple intelligence: 
The newest of the bunch, Apple Intelligence is Apple’s AI system, integrated into iPhones, iPads, and Macs to enhance user experience with advanced on-device AI and cloud-based processing. Announced in 2024, it powers features like smarter Siri, text generation, image editing, and personalized recommendations while prioritizing privacy through secure processing.

Apple Intelligence seamlessly works across Apple apps like Messages, Mail, and Notes, offering AI-driven assistance for writing, summarizing, and organizing content. It also integrates with third-party apps and services, positioning Apple as a key player in the AI space.

Now lets dive into some comparisons,

Availability:

ChatGPT and copilot are available to everybody, regardless of wether you have an account with OpenAI or Microsoft respectively, they are also both available on the web as a website, on the App Store and also on the Google Play store. Gemini is also available in the web however it requires users to have a google account and be over 13 years old. Deepseek is in a tricky situation at the moment, due to the fact that it is owned by a Chinese company, it has been removed from Google’s Play store and also the Apple App Store if you are in Italy amidst privacy concerns, also there is no MacOS compatible application. However, it is still available on their website but they are not accepting new sign-ups because their servers are too full. Apple Intelligence is the most restricted of the lot, only being available on Apple Silicon Macs, iPads with M series chips, and the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro and most likely the up and coming iPhone SE 4. This makes Apple Intelligence fall behind compared to its competitors however, it works seamlessly with Apple applications and third parties, flexing the control that Apple has over everything on their devices.

UI/UX:

This is one that is quite commonly ignored, however it is a vital role into your AI experience. Copilot has a beautiful UI with 2 different themes, day and night, they day theme consists of warm, orange tones and the night these is a navy blue and black theme. At the bottom of the display there is a floating bar where you can ask Copilot any questions, when a response is given you have three options, copy the response, dislike the response or like it. This minimalistic UI makes it easy for people to use. Gemini has a quite similar ui, however, the light and dark modes are the basic that we get with every Google service, it follows the same design language as other google services too, showing google’s consistency and attention to detail. ChatGPT is a design we are all very familiar with and it has most arguably the most functional UI, when using the MacOS app, the main body has a sort of transparency where you can see your desktop behind, it automatically switches between light and dark mode. There is a sidebar that displays all your previous chats. Then, deepseek has basically ChatGPT’s UI but more bland and less functional, also, the scaling on mobile is a bit interesting you could say. And lastly, Apple Intelligence has my personal favorite UI with lots of vibrant colors around a floating box and the ring around your device if you are on iPhone or iPad that responds to your voice. 

Headline/best feature:  Here’s an interesting one, the best feature of every AI, lets see what is the feature that is shown in All there marketing, something you HAVE to mention when talking about one of these Ai.
For Microsoft; it has to be the lack of a headline / best feature, copilot, as mentioned before, may be one of the most practical but maybe this is why they have no ”marketing gimmicks” or faff, no copilot is just plain functionality with a great UI
Gemini: Gemini, the headline feature of this has to be the fact that it runs natively on Google Pixel phones enabling some top notch photo editing, circle to search and a very intelligent every-day companion. This makes Gemini very accessible to the average user
ChatGPT: It has to be it’s new, top-level voice chat, this thing makes it sound like you have an actual person talking to you, enabling it to do different tones and also pauses, stutter and even LAUGH.
Apple Intelligence: If there is one thing apple is good at, it is marketing, from the classic iPod silhouette to pulling a MacBook Air out of an envelope, apple has had it’s fair share of marketing genius. So, what is it for Apple Intelligence. Genmoji. This is a feature highly anticipated by the younger audience, letting them express themselves in any way they feel
Deepseek: It’s cost, deepseek cost about 5% of what ChatGPT took to develop and it is open-source and free to use. Also, it caused American Companies to lose 1 TRILLION dollars in revenue, making it a big talking point in the stock market.


Thank you for reading Part 1 of this compelling series, there are more extensive comparisons where we ask the Ai to do tasks and answer questions side by side to see which AI is the bets. Stay tuned for Part 2 coming shortly!
