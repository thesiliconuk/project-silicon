Introduction

Logitech is a well-regarded brand, producing a diverse range of products from wireless mice to iPad keyboard cases. Their designs typically emphasize ergonomics, quality, and value. However, as with any brand, there can be variations in product performance. This review focuses on the Logitech Folio Touch.
Note: Throughout this review, the Logitech Folio Touch will be referred to as "the case."

Context

Logitech is a recognized manufacturer of computer accessories and office equipment, including keyboard cases for iPads. The product line includes the Rugged Folio, Combo Touch, and the Folio Touch. While these cases share similarities, they offer distinct features and specifications. This review will concentrate on the Folio Touch, which is characterized by:
 * Fabric exterior
 * Integrated keyboard
 * Backlit keys
 * Apple Pencil holder

Initial Impressions

Upon receiving the Logitech Folio Touch, my initial experience was positive. The case was immediately functional upon installation, requiring minimal setup. The trackpad performed effectively, supporting iPadOS gestures, and the keyboard provided a comfortable typing experience. Furthermore, the case offered robust protection for the iPad.

Deterioration

After approximately five months of use, signs of wear became apparent. The fabric around the speaker areas began to sag, and the material exhibited some shedding. Initially, these issues were minor and attributed to normal wear and tear. However, by late November, the deterioration had become more pronounced, with some keys displaying discoloration. While the condition remained relatively stable for the subsequent months, the issues were not resolved.

Functional Failure

In mid-February, the keyboard began to experience intermittent connectivity problems, culminating in a complete functional failure. This necessitated the use of the on-screen keyboard. Over the following weeks, the keyboard’s functionality became increasingly erratic, with brief periods of operation. Currently, the keyboard is unresponsive, and the iPad no longer recognizes its presence.

Evaluation

The Logitech Folio Touch presents an appealing feature set and delivers satisfactory performance initially. However, after five months, significant durability concerns arose. Considering the retail price (approximately £160), the product's longevity is questionable. Unless a temporary keyboard solution is required, alternative options should be considered.
Alternative Products
In addition to the Folio Touch, Logitech offers the Rugged Folio, which features a more durable construction and enhanced speaker cutouts. The Logitech Combo Touch, while initially exhibiting similar issues, has undergone revisions to address these concerns.

Conclusion

Product variations are inherent across all brands. Logitech demonstrates a commitment to customer feedback, as evidenced by the improvements made to the Combo Touch. It is hoped that similar revisions will be implemented for the Folio Touch.
