# iPhone 17 Rumors: What We Know So Far

## The iPhone 17 is quite a few months away from being released; here's a quick recap on the most credible rumors concerning Apple's next flagship.

### Design: Sleeker and More Durable

The frame will be made of titanium to make it lighter and more resistant. The design may feature something softer on edges, with some resemblance to the iPhone 12, and the camera bump might be even smaller. The colors might get some fresh tweaks, but not overly different. Like what they all say… “same as last year” but not so fast… there are some changes - trust us.

### Display: Cleaner and Brighter

The iPhone 17 might give the notch even a smaller footprint, or alternatively have an under-display camera for only the Pro models. The display quality should see some minor improvements with a brighter and more power-efficient OLED screen or just maybe micro-LED tech for all models. Do you think they will add 120hz ? 

### Performance: A19 Bionic Chip

Expecting that the iPhone 17 runs on the A19 Bionic chip that will be manufactured on the 3nm process; this was when the chip was promised to deliver untold speed and power efficiency. Expect spectacular performance upgrades with respect to AI, games, and AR. This chip will make your phone even more powerful being able to run intense graphic games on mobile much smoother and easily.

### Camera: Periscope Lens & More

Rumors say that the iPhone 17 Pro models will have a periscope lens for better zoom and lower-light performance, and more features will be added to the camera system to improve computational photography and allow users to shoot sharper photos. In addition, the camera layout may change for the iPhone 17 base model however the pro and pro max models may change with the camera module glass extending to both sides instead of just one side of the phone.

### Battery & Charging: More Efficient

With improvements in chip technology, battery life will probably improve, while charging speeds might get a boost. With the switch to USB-C  given because of EU regulations, faster and more universal charging would be made available. You can expect more and faster power now with the new models.

### Price - How much and what there is

* iPhone 17 (Base): The phone is a well-performing all-rounder at a good price (likely $799).
* iPhone 17 Pro: Advanced features, with better cameras, likely will cost about $1,099.

* iOS 19: More Software Enhancements (Article coming soon for iOS19)
* In the iOS 19-compliant iPhone 17, new features will include upgrades to AR, controls over enhanced privacy, and smarter functions driven by apple intelligence

## Conclusion

The iPhone 17 looks set to be an exciting story with the introduction of several features, such as the A19 Bionic chip, the switch to USB-C, and enhanced camera capabilities.
