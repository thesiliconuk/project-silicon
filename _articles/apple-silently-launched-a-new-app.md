5 days ago, February 4th, Apple unexpectedly released a new app, invites, we did know that Apple was working on a project but this was not really what we expected. Today, I am going to clear up everything you need to know about Apple Invites:

How can I download it?‚Ä®Anyone can download it on the app store however, you need to be in iOS 18, the invites app wont be available in older versions of iOS, also, many users are disappointed by the fact that the app is not available on iPad. The app currently has a 4.2 star rating on the App Store and also has shot up to No. 1 in the ‚Äùfreestyle‚Äù charts, ahead of Pinterest. The app comes in at 58.4MB on my iPhone 14 Pro and may slightly differ from device to device. 

But why?
Well, we have never really seen an App like this before, this app flexes the strength of the Apple Ecosystem showing how two iPhones can work wonders when paired together, also, this app can be very useful for people who are always going to events and parties as this gives them a way to organize all of their invitations. 

How?
When coming into the app there is a little plus icon in the top right corner next to an image of your AppleID profile picture. When you click on the plus button you get a ton of options presented in a very beautiful design, there are options for basically everything including name, date, location, description, and two features that many people are excited about and these are shared albums and shared Playlists, this enables people to see all the music that is being played at the venue and also any photos taken further enhancing how good the Apple Ecosystem really is. There is also a background image option and there are a ton of new photos and graphics for you to use, also, users with an iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16 or a 16Pro can use image playground to generate their own custom image for the poster.

Quirks 
Well, the design is something that we have not seen with any other app made by Apple, it follows a very glassy, transparent design, very similar to what we see on Vision Pro, many user speculate that this is what iOS 19 will look like when announced at WWDC25 but we dont know yet, also, the app features a light and dark mode icon both of which look very cool and you can see in the image.‚Äô

What‚Äôs the catch?
Well, users are quite disappointed with the fact that you need an iCloud+ [or AppleOne] subscription to actually invite people to an event, this means that people using the free tier can‚Äôt invite people to any events which has been a massive disappointment, however, if you are on the free tier you can still accept invites making the app not completely pointless for users on the free tier.
