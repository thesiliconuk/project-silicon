**Introduction** 

Hello, my name is Aalay and I am 12 years old. I will be joining The Silicon and I am excited to be sharing my first article.

My phone is more than just a device. For me, it’s a space that reflects my daily life, balancing my work, entertainment, and mindfulness.

**Organisation**

I have organised my home screen with emails and work apps like Gmail, Outlook, and Teams to ensure I stay on top of responsibilities, while YouTube, Spotify, and Snapchat bring me entertainment and connection. The to-do list widget keeps me responsible with all my tasks, whilst the large clock widget serves as a quick glance at the time when I have work to do.

**Lock Screen**

My lock screen, featuring a Buddha statue, adds a sense of calm every time I pick up my phone, helping me with my mindfulness. I took this photo with a lot of care to portray the ethics and teachings of Buddha in my life.

This wallpaper will hopefully be available for all to use in the future when you visit our wallpaper section.

**More on the wallpaper**

The soft glow on the statue and the grey background create a peaceful contrast to the digital world. It’s a visual reminder to breathe, slow down, and stay mindful. Paired with my wallpaper is the “Reduce Interruptions” focus mode. This focus mode helps me concentrate the best I can and forget the busy group chats and notifications that would otherwise sidetrack me.

**Conclusion** 

My phone isn’t just a collection of apps; it’s a carefully curated space that supports both my drive and my need for stillness. It helps me stay connected, get things done, and, most importantly, remember to be present in the moment.
