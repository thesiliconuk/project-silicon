Skype is officially shutting down on May 5, Skype was a video conferencing platform, popular among many different office spaces and even schools, however, since being acquired by Microsoft in 2011, it has slowly had less and less users. This is mainly because, it’s main competition, Slack and Microsoft Teams, really upped their game during covid, also, zoom, in the past 3 years has got many advanced features making it a compelling decision compared to the now, quite outdated Skype.

But why? 
Well, Skype is owned by Microsoft and so is Teams, and apparently, Microsoft wants to add more features (including AI) to teams, this means that there is no point in keeping Skype anymore.

What can I do?  If you work in a business or office space, and you are currently using Skype, I recommend speaking with your manager or whoever is in charge and propose switching to other services like Slack, Teams and Zoom. 

This was another short one, because there isn’t that much to say, also, we are currently working on thesilicon mobile so we don’t have much time for writing
