## Apple is preparing to launch its most design-focused iPhone yet: the iPhone 17 Air, expected in autumn of 2025. This new model will focus on ultra-thin design, lightweight build, and a fresh direction for Apple’s mid-to-premium lineup. While it won’t be the “Pro” model, the Air is still packed with modern features and performance, aimed at users who value portability and sleekness.


### Design

The iPhone 17 Air is rumored to be just 5.5mm thick, making it the thinnest iPhone ever made… let’s hope it’s not going to have the same issue Apple had with the 6. It will feature a 6.6-inch OLED display with 120Hz ProMotion for smoother visuals when scrolling, gaming, or watching videos. The frame will likely be made of Titanium once again to keep it ultra-light, and a new horizontal rear camera bar replaces the traditional corner camera bump. This design is expected to look more minimal and balanced, however, many people are already controversial about the design leaks.

### Chip and Performance

Under the hood, the iPhone 17 Air will run on Apple’s upcoming A19 chip, built using a 3nm process for better speed and energy efficiency. It will also come with 12GB of RAM, enough to handle multitasking, gaming, and future AI-based features in iOS, which is an upgrade from the 8GB last time.

### Modem and Connectivity

Apple is reportedly moving forward with its own C2 modem chip, a successor to the C1. This in-house modem may reduce reliance on Qualcomm and improve power efficiency. However, it may not include mmWave 5G support, which could slightly limit top-end 5G speeds in some regions. The phone will also support Wi-Fi 7, ensuring strong, future-ready wireless performance. Like recent iPhones, it’s expected to be eSIM-only with no physical SIM card slot. Be sure that this phone will keep you connected at all times.

### Camera

The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly feature a single 48MP rear camera, however — following the 16e and the M4 iPad Pro camera — still capable of delivering high-quality images thanks to Apple’s advanced image processing. It will also include a 24MP front camera for selfies and FaceTime. The focus here isn’t on multi-lens setups, but rather on keeping the phone slim while still offering great photo quality for everyday users. This camera will be sure to include telephoto too.

### Battery

One of the biggest trade-offs with the thin design is a smaller battery, which may not last a full day for all users. Early leaks suggest that 60–70% of users might get through the day on one charge. To address this, Apple may bring back the Smart Battery Case—a removable add-on that gives extra battery life without increasing the phone’s thickness all the time. The battery will not be as good as the 16, but do you think Apple will contradict us ?

### Other Features

The iPhone 17 Air is obviously expected to have USB-C, following Apple’s full transition away from Lightning. It will likely run iOS 18 or 19 out of the box, with future support for AI-enhanced features, better customization, and performance tools. There may also be updates to Face ID, display brightness, and speaker quality, though these haven’t been fully confirmed.

### Summary

The iPhone 17 Air is Apple’s attempt at blending a clean, ultra-portable design with solid performance and modern features. While it may not match the Pro models in camera versatility or battery life, it stands out as a stylish, capable phone that offers more than just looks. It’s ideal for users who prioritize design, weight, and daily reliability over maxed-out specs.
