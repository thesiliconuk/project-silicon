**The new iMessage app is my favourite feature of dub dub this year** 





iMessage just got a MASSIVE update. It includes many features including the BEAUTIFUL liquid glass, backgrounds, pools and more. 





**Backgrounds** 

Probably my favourite part of this, backgrounds. You can use built in ones that are animated and the highest quality but you can also use your own images and photos. When you change the background, the whole group chat will see it which is pretty cool. You can also generate your own backgrounds with Image playground which is pretty cool. 





**Polls**

This is a feature long overdue to messages. Apple intelligence can intelligently make polls for you. These can be useful for when you need to decide something.





**Cash?**

For some reason, Apple decided to add Apple Cash so you can send and receive money from the app. I only see one use case for this. When a kid asks their parents for money this could be a quick way. 





**Typing indicators** 

Something else that was supposed to be here a long time ago, now you can keep track of who is typing when the group chat is blowing up. 





**No more random spam**

Just like in the phone app, screening tools comes to iMessage to get rid of those pesky scams from unknown numbers. Verification codes and time sensitive notifications will remain though,
