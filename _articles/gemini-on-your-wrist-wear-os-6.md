In Google’s Android Show, Wear OS 6 was announced. So what features will it have?


Wear OS 6 will ‘embrace the circular screen’ on Pixel and Samsung watches, meaning that the design will be ‘more circular’ offering a ‘sense of depth’ to the experience. 

Wear OS 6 will also include Google's new Material 3 Expressive design, which includes similar features to that of Watch OS.  

Wear OS 6 will also increase battery life by up to 10% meaning you will have an even longer battery life on your smart watch. 

Last, but certainly not least: it has been announced that Google Gemini will be coming to Wear OS 6. As well as this, it will also include Gemini Live, meaning that you can chat with Gemini, or ask it to summarise an email that you received.
