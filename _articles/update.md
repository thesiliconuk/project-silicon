Introduction

A happy Monday to you all!

Firstly, we want to say thank you to those who have been following and supporting us, it means a lot! 

It is Tuesday 11th February, meaning our website has been online for the last week. In those two weeks, a lot has happened, and a lot is planned for the future. So here is an update of what has happened at The Silicon, and our future plans.

How Far We've Come


Since we created thesilicon.uk, a lot has happened. One of the first features we implemented was a ‘dark mode.’ This worked well, unless you refreshed the page. So our Head of Coding, Rohan went to work fixing this. Within a few days, Rohan had fixed it; we now had a fully functioning dark mode! Next, we got to work on writing an ‘About Us’ page. Soon, this was on our website and things were now starting to fall into place. We then started a YouTube channel, with our first video being our release trailer. We could now add a link from our website to our channel and vice versa. Then, it was time to create an article, simply called ‘Hello World.’ This article just highlighted what the website was about and what we wanted people to learn from it. A couple of days later, we finally released our first official article: ‘The iPhone SE 4 - what we know.’ Then, we were able to write an article about Apple Invites. And then, we launched our login and comment system; this was an absolute success! This brings us roughly up to date with our previous article being on the subject of the upcoming Nothing Phone 3a.

What Next?

The website is far from complete, as we intend to make the design more modern, by adding animations and updating the comment and login system. Of course, we are going to keep to our commitment of writing two articles a day, and creating more superb abstract wallpapers (credit to Badie.) We also intend to start reviews on tech products, so keep an eye out for them!

Our best wishes,
The Silicon.
