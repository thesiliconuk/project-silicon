If you have a Vision Pro, you would already know that this app exists. However, to us normal peopleâ€¦
â€¦We donâ€™t just have a Vision Pro lying around. 

The new Vision Pro app is aimed to be a hub for all of the latest features available on their Â£3500 VR/AR headset. I just downloaded the app on the App Store and I have just come across an iOS bug. Because I have just installed the app, I would expect it to be in the â€™Recently addedâ€™ section in my app drawer. However, I am not finding it there. I am not sure if others are experiencing this on iOS 18.4

I know most of you wonâ€™t be using this app but Apple installed it onto everyone who has a Vision Proâ€™s iPhone with iOS 18.4 automatically. Here are some screenshots I took from the app:
