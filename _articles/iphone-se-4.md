Ahh, the iPhone SE, a phone that has the design of a phone from 8 years ago, the only iPhone you can currently buy (on Apple’s official website [dependent on your region]) that has Face ID. However, rumors have been floating around for years now about a new iteration of this model, the iPhone SE 4. It is said to be a MASSIVE leap forward, bringing a modern design, good cameras and Face ID to a (hopefully) sub £500 phone.

Why?

But why? Well, rulings from the EU stated that all products must have USB-C by 2025 so this meant, at the end of 2024 Apple had to remove the iPhone SE and iPhone 14 from its site in EU countries. You can still buy them here in the UK and other non-EU countries, but the EU is one of Apple’s biggest markets so removing 2 products isn't exactly what Apple needs. So Apple has to get a replacement out FAST because otherwise they might be losing out on the very competitive budget phone market where phones like the Nothing Phone, Samsung A series and the last year's Google Pixels are all fighting for the top spot as best budget phone, Apple needs to get their product out. Also, it is time for a refresh, the design on the current iPhone SE is the one from the iPhone 8, a phone released in September 2017! 2017! That was 8 years ago now!

So what do we know?

Well, there have been many rumors going around for the past 8 months and there are many features we have confirmed. First of all, we will be getting an iPhone 14 like design, so that is Flat sides, a 6.1” display, most likely a notch. Also, on the backside of the phone we will be getting a single, 48MP camera, yes, the same 48MP camera that we have on the new, $800 iPhone 16, however, we will only be getting one lens just like the current iPhone SE. There are rumored to be lots of vibrant colors, similar to what we got with the iPhone 5c back in the day, making the phone appealing to younger audiences as Apple is ready to enter the mid-range phone market. The display will be, as mentioned before, a 6.1” OLED panel, however, something that has really annoyed people is the fact that it will still be a 60HZ display when phones that are around $350 like the Google Pixel 8 have a 60hz display. The battery will be around 3800MAH which will be great compared to the old iPhone SE, speaking of the battery, the new iPhone SE 4 will have USB-C a long-awaited feature that will get Apple that one step closer to one cable for all devices. We will also be getting an Action Button, a feature introduced with the iPhone 15 Pro in 2023, letting users map the button to whatever they want, saying goodbye to the good old ring-silent switch. One thing that is heavily anticipated is Apple’s own 5G chip instead of the one used by Qualcomm in the past, this is a first for iPhone and gives Apple all the more flexibility with their devices as they make everything. We will also be getting an A18 Chip, which means that there will be 8GB of ram to support Apple Intelligence, a feature not available on the now $600 Apple iPhone 15 Plus.

So, what is the catch???

Well, as mentioned before as well, the iPhone SE 4 having a 60hz display has really upset some people, however, I think that the way iOS works, 60hz should be fine and it really isn’t that noticeable unless you put them side by side, the normal user won't notice, and if you are a power user, you would be much better off with a Pro level iPhone, also, we are not sure of the price it is only rumored to be $499, however, Apple could charge as much as $639 if they wanted to. Also, the notch is a slight turn-off for some, for me, it has quite literally changed the way I use my phone, but it isn’t a necessity, I could go back at any time.

Should I buy it?
I think this is a good phone for anyone looking to get into the Apple Ecosystem or they have an older iPhone that doesn’t have Apple Intelligence, me, I use an iPhone 14 Pro, so I am missing out on a lot of these new Apple Intelligence features. Also, this phone will be getting around 6 years of software support so it is a good investment to keep you going for a long time.
