App Tuesday Number 2 is here! Have you always got last in a habit that you wanted to track? You have tried all the random, over cluttered habit keepers. Well, this app will be perfect for you!

The app is called HabitKit and it is essentially just a habit tracker. However, something cool is that it is displayed in a very similar way to Github contributions and, if you do use it, you know it is annoying wen you have a gap inside so this basically motivates you to stay on top of your habits, whatever they are. 

The app is so frequently used by me that I put a shortcut to open it inside my control center so I can quickly complete a Habit that I am logging. There is also a PRO version that gives you widgets and the ability for 5+ habits, however, I think the base version will be fine as it lets you track up to FOUR habits.

Here are some screenshots that I took from the app just to showcase the UI. (*I have blurred out one of the habits as it is related to an exciting project that I am working on.*)
