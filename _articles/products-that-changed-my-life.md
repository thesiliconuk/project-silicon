Life changing. This is how good the upcoming products are going to be. They changed my life and not all of them are necessarily tech products. So, in no particular order, here are the 4 things that changed MY life for the better.

Please note that I will not be going over obvious products like my laptop and phone.

Product 1:

My SAMSUNG WB150F Camera, this camera, though very old takes some really good pictures. Sure, the resolution is not the best but for the price that you can get this for it is very good. I do not recommend it to anyone who wants to get into photography though because it isn’t the best camera out there. Even though I am a photographer and I use my iPhone camera for most shots, there is something about sing a proper camera that just brings me a lot of joy, it makes me calm and relaxed and that is what I value, not the image quality of the camera. If I am looking for a actual good shot I will pull out my iPhone 14 Pro but it just doesn’t feel the same as tinkering around with the settings on a camera until you get it just right. This camera hold so much significance to me that it is my profile picture across all my social medias.

Product 2:

The Apple Watch. 2 years ago, in 2023, I purchased my first ever Apple Watch, the series 9 in midnight with the midnight sport band. Sure, it does all the sleep and health tracking I expected and that has been life changing. But what has been life changing for me is the fact that it takes me away from my tech, I am not constantly reaching out for my phone anymore as I know that if something important comes through I will be notified on the watch. The Apple Watch really is one of my favourite tech purchases ever and I really recommend one to anyone

Product 3:

The third product is my toothbrush, last year I decided to ditch my normal, regular, plain toothbrush and decided to pick up the SURI toothbrush. This toothbrush is very Apple-esque in terms of its design and it is also very environmentally friendly. The toothbrush is really beautiful and in the box comes with some really cool accessories, you get a wall mount which you will stick onto your wall with the very strong adhesive on the back and now the toothbrush magnetically attaches to it, very similar to the Apple Watch puck or MagSafe. You also get a charger and you can get a carrying case extra which I think is a nice touch. All the accessories are in a sort of marble, rock finish which is very fitting for a bathroom environment. The carrying case can also charge the brush (with USBC) and it has a UV cleaning light as well. The brush has 2 different modes indicated by the small (but very bright) LED just above the button that is flesh with the design.

If you would like to get the brush or just check it out see their website here: [](https://trysuri.com)

Product 4: 

My notebook. I am one of those people who carry a notebook everywhere but not for the purposes other people do. No, as a graphic/web designer I like to spend alot of my free time planning designs with pencil and paper in my notebook. My latest wallpaper pack, minimalist gradients was designed inside this notebook until I made it in Figma later. In this notebook I also just like to sketch images of things like phones, computers and watches. It just brings me a sense of calmness and takes me away from my technology.

This was it for this article. If you are wondering why he haven’t uploaded in so long well, as the holiday season comes around, we have token a short break but we are back to our consistent upload schedule here on forth.
