It is official, google will be retiring google assistant by the end of 2025, meaning you will no longer be able to download it from any app stores, access the website and it wonâ€™t be your phoneâ€™s assistant. Google did this because Gemini is now coming in to replace it slowly, becoming the default assistant on all new phones and tablets. Google said [â€™It is an upgradeâ€™](http://https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-assistant-gemini-mobile/) which makes sense as Assistant pales in comparison compared to Gemini. Gemini is much more powerful and can do many more things. But my question is: What will happen to the Nest Hub? I have a nest hub mini sitting on my desk and I feel like Google needs to release a new version especially as Appleâ€™s Homepad is rumored to come soon with Apple intelligence support, the nest hub *needs* gemini support to be able to rival it if it comes out.

I am currently working on a secret project, details will be released soon! However, due to this, I canâ€™t write too many articles in the coming few weeks.
