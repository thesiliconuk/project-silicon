Second thing in the Air today (read about MacBook Air in previous article), but this one is too heavy to fly and it has to stay on your desk. This is an upgrade we have been waiting a long time for. The new Mac Studio just dropped hereâ€™s all you need to know:

Brief overview

* M4 Max or M3 ULTRA
* Starts from Â£2,099 for M4 Max 
* Starts from Â£4,199 for M3 Ultra
* Most powerful Macs ever made
* Up to a 32 Core CPU
* An up to 80 Core GPU
* Thunderbolt 5


These new Macs are going to be very popular among those who need the most power possible (and have lots of money). However, I am confused as to why they didnâ€™t give us a stealthy black variant, I mean, it makes sense, we arenâ€™t going to be touching it alot so the fingerprint situation wonâ€™t be bad and also we have the Apple TV in black already anywayâ€¦

Besides that, it comes with Thunderbolt 5 support now and the new chips are way too fast, I think it would be difficult to stress them out. This new Mac Studio is a great move from Apple, as it releases the previous Mac Studio that was long awaiting an update. The only thing concerning me is that the Mac Pro seems to have been forgotten because it is still on M2 Ultra/Max so we donâ€™t know when those are getting an upgrade.


What do you think? Is it too expensive? Let us know below ðŸ‘‡
