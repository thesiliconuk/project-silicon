Amazon has just showcased their latest update to the most popular (and most affordable) virtual assistant in the market, the Alexa.

Alexa+ is a new AI powered smart home device that claims to have many benefits over the current gen assistant. These include the device understanding colloquial expressions which allows you to talk to it more naturally. They have also made it more personalised by feeding it with your data, which they are undoubtedly making a profit off of. 

That's not the only way they are squeezing money out of you. Alexa+ starts at £19.99 a month, which is a ridiculous amount of money that no one should be paying. And this is because they have also bundled Alexa+ with Amazon Prime, which is only £8.99 a month, meaning anyone who actually pays just for Alexa+ is getting scammed. Guess they didn't think that one through. On the bright side, this means that anyone with an Alexa can enjoy this new feature because lets be real, no one has an Alexa in their house and doesn't have Prime. It also comes with a fresh new look and feel for those with an Echo Show, with rounded corners and an acrylic design on the widgets, which looks a lot better than the old design.
