iOS 18.5 was recently released to all iPhone users previously on iOS 18.4.1

It adds:

A new pride wallpaper
Small updates

But the Mail app was also slightly updated and there is a setting you must turn on. When you now open the app you can see the three dots to open a new settings menu. Here, you can turn off the mail categories or turn them on and also find out about mail categories. However, the setting I want to talk about is the setting at the bottom, ’Show contact photos’ , what it does is it enables the icons for the senders so you can easily see who is sending you a message. I recommend turning this on as it looks really clean and also does show the photo for the person sending the email. 

Are you using this setting?
