What is the best browser for MacOS, well, as surprising as it is, it is not the arc browser. I will be ranking my top 6 browsers for Mac that I have actually seen people use, let‚Äôs go right in!


6. Opera Browser

This browser has way too many features for a person like myself who enjoys simplicity and minimalism. The browser also is very gamer oriented, however, the only game I play is crossy road üòÖ so there isn‚Äôt any compelling features in there for me. The aria AI is pretty good, but, on the Mac we have the option space keyboard shortcut for ChatGPT anyway.

5. Microsoft Edge

Yes, I ranked this above Opera, anyways, this browser is quite bad, it is very slow on my M1 MacBook Pro. Also, it is lacking in features and the design seems very old. There isn‚Äôt anything I particularly like about Microsoft Edge (perhaps from the app icon but that isn‚Äôt very important)

4. Google Chrome

This is probably not going to fare well with most of you, but I put chrome in 4th place. I have 2 reasons for this, first, it is very slow and secondly, I can‚Äôt trust google after the while incognito mode scandal ü´®. The only thing good about this browser is the fact that the google chrome extension store has ‚Äùcstimer+‚Äù an extension that isn‚Äôt available on safari. The cstimer+ extension is just an extension for my rubiks cube timer website. Also, the dev tools on Chrome are really good for web development.


Top 3 now, these browsers are the ones I recommend to people when they ask me what the best browser on MacOS is:

3. Arc

If we were 2 months back, I would‚Äôve ranked Arc as first, however, Arc is kind of dead. I know, it hurts to say after all the hype when it was released. I just can‚Äôt see myself going back to Arc even though I used it for more than half a year. The thing is, it is probably one of the slowest browsers out there, sure, it has a beautiful UI but that isn‚Äôt worth it for a slow browser. However, if you don‚Äôt mind about speed, I recommend this browser. 

2. Firefox 

Firefox, a browser that is really underrated, this browser has a decent UI, has most of the chrome extensions, is quite fast and is actually secure (cough, Google Chrome) The only reason it isn‚Äôt in first is because many people complain about websites often crashing (something I too have run into). It isn‚Äôt the most reliable browser out there but it does get the job done. 

1. Safari üëë 

Hot take, Safari is the best browser for MacOS, it comes pre-installed, there‚Äôs no clutter, just a great minimalist UI, that is much more functional than any other browsers in this list. Also, Apple has really improved safari over the past few years, especially with the introduction of passwords, and the fact that I can view a website from. My iPhone on my Mac in a matter of seconds. Also, it is the most power efficient browser on this list, and, as a person who does web development trust me, I like all the battery life I can have. 


Why didn‚Äôt I include Zen browser?

Main reason I didn‚Äôt include the Zen browser is because it is in development, it isn‚Äôt finished and it is VERY buggy at the moment. 



Right, thats it for this one, also, we have included new features to the article viewer, including italic, bold, underlined texts, lists, image insertion and more!
