***Introduction***

The Samsung A series of phone is a brilliant mid-range phone, offering a good mix of budget and flagship features. However, Samsung have, in the past few weeks, released the newest version: the Galaxy A56. So, is it still delivering the same performance, or not?

***Design and Screen***

The Galaxy A56 comes in 4 colours: 
   -Awesome Graphite (grey)
   -Awesome Olive (green)
   -Awesome Lightgrey (white)
   -Awesome Pink (pink)
As I am sure you can tell, there has been some criticism on the way Samsung have named their phones, and I must admit the repetition of ‘awesome’ does get ever so slightly boring. On the flip side, Samsung may have used this marketing to make it appealing to a younger audience. The Galaxy A56 comes with a 6.7 inch Super AMOLED display at 120 Hz. It also features an always on display. The Galaxy A56 has 3 cameras, in a new ‘joined together’ design. 
***Battery and Durability ***

The Galaxy A56 has a 5000 mAh battery, offering 29 hours of screen-on time. It also has IP67 water resistance, meaning you don’t have to worry if your phone gets dunked in water for a couple of minutes! It also has Victus+.

***Competition***

Personally, I would not really buy the A56, as there are better phones on the market at a similar price, particularly the Nothing Phone 3a and also the Samsung S24 Fe. And if you are prepared to push your budget and are a Samsung fan, I would recommend the Samsung S25.

***Verdict***

The Samsung Galaxy A56 is a good phone for the price, it has good features but there are better phones out there for a similar price.
